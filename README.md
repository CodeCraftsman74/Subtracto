**To play the above game you have to run the code and this is the the information of how to play the game.**
1. The interpreter/computer picks a number from 20-30=value.
2. Once the number is picked we take input from user to pick a number from 1-3 =user input.
3. Here computer/interpreter reduces/subtracts the user input from the randomly picked number i.e value=value-user value.
4. Computer also picks a random digit from 1-3 and subtracts it from value.
5. This process goes on until the number reaches less than zero or zero.
6. The first person to reach the 0 or negative number is the loser.
7. And the other is the winner.
